Please do not use blindly these files. Read and use only what you want. Winter will come if you ignore these warnings intentionally.

# todo
1. change vundle to vimplug
2. add Hightlight to installed things

# Most important things from my current CLI/VIM usage

Most important thing for me is an ability to quickly search for 3 things: files, content of a file, commands.

|  Fast search  |      Terminal       |  Vim   |
|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| Files         | CTRL+T              | :Files |
|               | fzf --preview       | CTRL+P |
|               | z                   |        |
| Files Content | rg                  | :Rg    |
| Commands      | CTRL+R              |        |
|               | CTRL+S              |        |
|               | zsh-autosuggestions |        |
